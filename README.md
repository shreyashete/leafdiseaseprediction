Tomato leaf disease detection using convolutional neural networks

Development of automatic leaf disease detection system using advanced computer technology such as image processing help to support the farmers in the identification of diseases at an early or initial stage when they scan and capture the infected leaf and provide useful information about solution for its prevention and spread of diseases. Detection of leaf spot disease using following techniques such as CNN algorithm image acquisition feature extraction, image pre-processing, and disease classification can be done. Different algorithms can be used for the detection disease.
